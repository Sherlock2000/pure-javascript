----------------------------------------------------

+ **<JQuery's function name (of which you have the javascript equivalent) >**
 
Tell whether the javascript equivalent function you are providing is **inbuilt** in javascript or you have a created a  **custom** function for it  ? ( _inbuilt_ or _custom_ )

**Description of the Javascript equivalent here**

--------------------------------------------------------
